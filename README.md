# AEM Webpack Example

This project demonstrates a proven practice for setting up Webpack in AEM. It provides a straightforward Webpack configuration and supports Babel and ESLint.

The structure of this project mirrors Adobe's [Project Archetype](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype/tree/master/src/main/archetype). To get started, you can either [set up a new project](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype) using the archetype, or you use your existing project. Then...

## Integrate Webpack into AEM

Here's a step-by-step summary. Each step links to a folder that contains a README file with more instructions.

1. [Copy the example Webpack folder](ui.apps/src/main) to `ui.apps/src/main`.
2. [Copy .babelrc and .eslintrc](ui.apps/src/main) to `ui.apps/src/main`.
3. [Extend the project's pom.xml](ui.apps).

This is already enough to run the project's Maven build and Webpack. Try it now! Then you want to modify a few more things:

4. [Use the generated files on your page](ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/etc/designs/__appsFolderName__/clientlib-components), for example by including them in a clientlib.
5. [Adjust filters](ui.apps/src/main/content/META-INF/vault) in `ui.apps/src/main/content/META-INF/vault`.
6. [Add files generated by Webpack to .gitignore](ui.apps/src/main).

## Tips

- Speed up development using [AEM Front](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aem-front). If used, Webpack can be run from the [webpack](ui.apps/src/main/webpack) folder. There's no need to run Maven every time a JavaScript or CSS change should be deployed to a local AEM instance. Instead, use Webpack's watch tasks in combination witih AEM Front.
