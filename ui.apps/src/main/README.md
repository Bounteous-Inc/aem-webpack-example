# Webpack folder

Copy the two Webpack folders into your project:

- `webpack.core` contains basic configurations for npm, Webpack, Babel and Jest. Our goal for further development of this project is to allow you to update this folder without having to manually configure it again. For that reason, since version 2.0.0, we have a second folder...
- `webpack.project` is meant to contain your project-specific configuration. It allows you to override and extend certain parts of `webpack.core`. Check out [the folder's index.js](./webpack.project/index.js) for more details.

# .babelrc

Copy `.babelrc` which is needed for Babel to work.

# .gitignore

A .gitignore file should be added to the project so the files generated by Webpack are not version-controlled. Nobody should ever modify them directly, so you don't have to track them in Git.

```
**/webpack.bundles/*.bundle.*
```
