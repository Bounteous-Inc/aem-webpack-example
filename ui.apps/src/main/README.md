# Webpack folder

Copy the two Webpack folders as well as `.babelrc` (for Babel) and `.stylelintrc` (for Stylelint) into your project:

- `webpack.core` contains basic configurations for npm, Webpack, Babel and Jest. Our goal for further development of this project is to allow you to update this folder without having to manually configure it again. For that reason, since version 2.0.0, we have a second folder...
- `webpack.project` is meant to contain your project-specific configuration. It allows you to override and extend certain parts of `webpack.core`. Check out [the folder's index.js](./webpack.project/index.js) for more details.
- `.babelrc` (for Babel), `.eslintrc.js` (for ESLint) and `.stylelintrc` (for Stylelint) in a parent/ancestor folder of the content folder, we avoid errors potentially occurring while files in the content folder are processed.

# .gitignore

A .gitignore file should be added to the project so the files generated by Webpack are not version-controlled. Nobody should ever modify them directly, so you don't have to track them in Git.

```
**/webpack.bundles/*.bundle.*
```
