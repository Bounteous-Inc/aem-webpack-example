# webpack.module

This is really just an example for a folder that will be picked up by Webpack. This illustrates how to write JavaScript modules in an AEM project. Note the structure: `webpack.module/index.js`. This matches the pattern defined in [components.js](../../../webpack/bundles/components.js). JavaScript files named differently or placed in a different folder will be ignored.
